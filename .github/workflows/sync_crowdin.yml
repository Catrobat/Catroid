# ** Synchronize Crowdin translation **
#
# Crowdin is a platform to manage the translation process in the Catroweb project:
#
#   1. We upload our english (base) translation files
#   2. Users worldwide translate our provided strings
#   3. We download the translations (In case translations are missing english is the fallback)
#
# This GitHub Action uses the official action from Crowdin to automate step 1 and 2.
# A pull request is created/updated automatically containing all new translations.
#
# - Secrets required!
#
name: Synchronize Crowdin

#
# New base strings could be uploaded on the merge of a new feature.
# However, the translation download process is independent from a pull request.
# Hence, keeping a consistent schedule once a day is more than enough.
#
# In case, an additional run is required, a manual dispatch trigger is also enabled.
#

  schedule:
   - cron:  '0 0 * * *'

jobs:

  #
  # - Two-way synchronization:
  #     -- In case of new strings in the repo, they are uploaded to Crowdin
  #     -- In case of new translation, a pull request containing all changes will be created or updated
  #
  # - The crowdin configuration is in `crowdin.yml`. However, without credentials!
  #
  # - The credentials are provided as secrets to the action as environment variables.
  #   In case they must be updated, talk to a product owner.
  #
  synchronize-with-crowdin:
    # Only should run on the main repo. (Running without the secrets would result in a fail anyway!)
