# Catroid
Catroid is a visual coding IDE and interpreter for the Catrobat programming language on Android. To create a manageable and less complex environment, we divided our Catroid team into two subteams:
- **Catroid-IDE** takes care of "Pocket Code's" visual coding IDE, i.e., the "Lego-Style" programming framework you used to create your first game.
- **Catroid-Stage** is responsible for developing the interpreter that enables the execution of the programs. Whenever you press the play button in "Pocket Code", that's the point when you move from IDE to Stage.


## Team Culture
We work as a team and expect everyone to follow the rules. In our daily work, we use the methods listed below to create high-quality code. We support each other but also anticipate newcomers to learn about our coding principles proactively:

- [Test-Driven Development](http://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment)
- [Clean Code](https://www.planetgeek.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Clean-Code-V2.2.pdf)
- Jira Workflow
- Style Guide
- Code Reviews
- Pair Programming
- Weekly Meetings (remote)
