First Steps

The Project is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroid).

1. Get the repo via shell: `git clone git@github.com:Catrobat/Catroid.git`
2. Drink some coffee - the repo size is about 62 MBs (2013-06-10)
3. Open Eclipse and select a workspace of your choice
4. Import every project from the cloned repo (File > Import... > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > Next > Select root directory (browse to it, confirm and wait until Eclipse shows you all projects below) > Finish
5. Wait until Eclipse reads/compiles everything
6. Maybe some cleanups will help to clear any compile errors - if any (Project > Clean... > Clean all projects > OK)
7. Also take care that a Project Build Target is chosen (Project > Properties > Android > choose any Build Target of your choice > OK)

Warning
---------
 
egit (Eclipse extension for git) will ignore some git settings and will make trouble with line endings!
