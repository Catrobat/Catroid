# Contributing #

If you want to contribute we suggest that you start with forking our repository and browse the code. Then you can look at our [Issue-Tracker](https://jira.catrob.at/browse/CAT/) and start with fixing one or two bug. We are developing test-driven, so every pull request should include appropriate tests and must only contain one bugfix. After you've created a pull request we will review your code and do a full testrun (about 3 hours) on your branch.

If you want to implement a new feature, please ask about the details in JIRA or our IRC channel (#catrobat or #catrobatdev) first.

Let's start to set up the working environment using the instructions in our  [Wiki](https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroid/wiki/Setup-working-environment)!
