The Java player for Scratch is written in a combination of Java and Logo. The Java code includes a simple Logo interpreter and low-level support for sprites, drawing, image effects, etc. The Logo code implements the Scratch blocks interpreter and the Scratch commands.

There are two variations of the code. ScratchApplet.jar is used to play Scratch projects on the Scratch website. ScratchPlayer.jar is a stand-alone Java program that I find helpful for debugging. That latter includes a text window that can be used to evaluate Logo commands and print values. Some commands useful during development are:

	open "foo			// opens the Scratch project foo.sb
	load "commands		// re-loads the Logo code in commands.log

One key module is "ObjReader.java", which reads Scratch project files and turns them into an array of objects. When a project is loaded some additional processing on this structure is done by Logo code in sprite.logo.
